"""this will be my first attempt at a test file for a game using TDD principals.  The idea behind this file is that it is built concurrently and before functions
enter in to the code base.  There is an overall object which holds the tests.  This object then defines methods which describe the details of the testing
situation (variables, objects on which the test depends, etc.) An assertion is declared at the end of a method with the expected results.  Then, a function 
and whatever else is added to the code of the program itself to make ALL these tests pass when this file is run. This should force me to focus on modeling the
action that must be taken to get from the current state of the program to one that implements the new feature (ie, passes all the tests) in as simple and clean
a manner as possible.  Done right, I should end up with a particularly resilient codebase as a result."""
